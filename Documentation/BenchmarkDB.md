# Database Benchmark: PostgreSQL vs MongoDB vs MariaDB

This document provides a quick comparison of three major database technologies—**PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, and **MariaDB**—based on their **performance**, **scalability**, and **maintainability**.

## 1. PostgreSQL

**Overview**: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for its **advanced features**, **complex query capabilities**, and **ACID compliance**.

### Performance:
- Excellent for handling **complex queries**, **joins**, and **analytics**.
- Uses **multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)** to handle concurrent reads and writes efficiently.
- Optimized for **transactional systems** and **data integrity**.

### Scalability:
- Supports **vertical scaling** and **horizontal scaling** with extensions like **Citus** (for distributed queries).
- Features **replication** (synchronous and asynchronous) and **clustering** for large-scale deployments.

### Maintainability:
- **Rich ecosystem** with many extensions (e.g., **PostGIS** for geospatial data).
- Excellent **documentation** and **community support** make it easy to manage.
- Well-suited for complex applications needing high consistency.

**Strengths**:
- **Best for complex, relational data**.
- Great for **analytics** and **transactional systems**.

## 2. MongoDB

**Overview**: MongoDB is a **NoSQL**, **document-based database** designed for scalability and flexibility, particularly with unstructured or semi-structured data.

### Performance:
- **High write throughput**, especially for **large datasets**.
- Optimized for **horizontal scaling** through **sharding**.
- **Schema-less** design makes it easy to adapt to changing data structures.

### Scalability:
- Known for **easy horizontal scaling** across many nodes.
- Built-in **replication** and **auto-sharding** for large-scale environments.

### Maintainability:
- Flexible schema design makes it easier to evolve data models.
- **Consistency** can be a challenge in distributed environments, but **transactions** (from version 4.x onwards) provide stronger guarantees.

**Strengths**:
- **Ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data**.
- Excellent for applications requiring high **write throughput** and scalability.

## 3. MariaDB

**Overview**: MariaDB is a **MySQL-compatible relational database** known for its high-performance capabilities and advanced storage engines.

### Performance:
- **Faster than MySQL** in certain scenarios (e.g., **write-heavy workloads**).
- Supports multiple **storage engines** like **InnoDB** (for transactional workloads) and **ColumnStore** (for analytics).
- **Optimized for real-time processing** and low-latency reads.

### Scalability:
- Offers **horizontal scaling** through clustering tools like **Galera Cluster** and **Spider**.
- Can handle **read-heavy workloads** with ease but may require additional tools for complex analytics.

### Maintainability:
- Highly compatible with **MySQL**, making migration and management easier.
- Regular updates and strong community support ensure ongoing maintenance.

**Strengths**:
- Great for **web applications** needing high performance and compatibility with **MySQL**.
- Excellent for **read-heavy** workloads and **real-time processing**.

## TL;DR

- **PostgreSQL** is the most **balanced** option for complex, relational databases with advanced query needs. It's great for **large-scale, transactional systems** requiring **high consistency** and data integrity.
- **MongoDB** shines when dealing with **unstructured data** and requires **scalability** with high **write throughput**. It's an excellent choice for **NoSQL** applications that need flexibility.
- **MariaDB** is a powerful, **MySQL-compatible option**, ideal for **web applications** and **real-time analytics**. It's well-suited for **read-heavy workloads** and offers **high compatibility** with MySQL.

## **Our Choice: PostgreSQL**

After evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each database technology, we have chosen **PostgreSQL** for our database needs. Here are the key reasons for our decision:

- **Advanced Features**: PostgreSQL offers advanced features like complex queries, joins, and analytics, which are essential for our application's requirements.
- **Performance**: Its use of multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) ensures efficient handling of concurrent reads and writes, making it ideal for transactional systems.
- **Scalability**: PostgreSQL supports both vertical and horizontal scaling, with extensions like Citus for distributed queries, ensuring it can grow with our needs.
- **Maintainability**: The rich ecosystem, excellent documentation, and strong community support make PostgreSQL easy to manage and maintain.
- **Data Integrity**: PostgreSQL's ACID compliance ensures high consistency and data integrity, which are crucial for our application's reliability.
