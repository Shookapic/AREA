# Database Benchmark: PostgreSQL vs MongoDB vs MariaDB

This document provides a quick comparison of three major database technologies—**PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, and **MariaDB**—based on their **performance**, **scalability**, and **maintainability**.

## 1. PostgreSQL

**Overview**: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for its **advanced features**, **complex query capabilities**, and **ACID compliance**.

### Performance:
- Excellent for handling **complex queries**, **joins**, and **analytics**.
- Uses **multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)** to handle concurrent reads and writes efficiently.
- Optimized for **transactional systems** and **data integrity**.

### Scalability:
- Supports **vertical scaling** and **horizontal scaling** with extensions like **Citus** (for distributed queries).
- Features **replication** (synchronous and asynchronous) and **clustering** for large-scale deployments.

### Maintainability:
- **Rich ecosystem** with many extensions (e.g., **PostGIS** for geospatial data).
- Excellent **documentation** and **community support** make it easy to manage.
- Well-suited for complex applications needing high consistency.

**Strengths**:
- **Best for complex, relational data**.
- Great for **analytics** and **transactional systems**.

## 2. MongoDB

**Overview**: MongoDB is a **NoSQL**, **document-based database** designed for scalability and flexibility, particularly with unstructured or semi-structured data.

### Performance:
- **High write throughput**, especially for **large datasets**.
- Optimized for **horizontal scaling** through **sharding**.
- **Schema-less** design makes it easy to adapt to changing data structures.

### Scalability:
- Known for **easy horizontal scaling** across many nodes.
- Built-in **replication** and **auto-sharding** for large-scale environments.

### Maintainability:
- Flexible schema design makes it easier to evolve data models.
- **Consistency** can be a challenge in distributed environments, but **transactions** (from version 4.x onwards) provide stronger guarantees.

**Strengths**:
- **Ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data**.
- Excellent for applications requiring high **write throughput** and scalability.

## 3. MariaDB

**Overview**: MariaDB is a **MySQL-compatible relational database** known for its high-performance capabilities and advanced storage engines.

### Performance:
- **Faster than MySQL** in certain scenarios (e.g., **write-heavy workloads**).
- Supports multiple **storage engines** like **InnoDB** (for transactional workloads) and **ColumnStore** (for analytics).
- **Optimized for real-time processing** and low-latency reads.

### Scalability:
- Offers **horizontal scaling** through clustering tools like **Galera Cluster** and **Spider**.
- Can handle **read-heavy workloads** with ease but may require additional tools for complex analytics.

### Maintainability:
- Highly compatible with **MySQL**, making migration and management easier.
- Regular updates and strong community support ensure ongoing maintenance.

**Strengths**:
- Great for **web applications** needing high performance and compatibility with **MySQL**.
- Excellent for **read-heavy** workloads and **real-time processing**.

## TL;DR

- **PostgreSQL** is the most **balanced** option for complex, relational databases with advanced query needs. It's great for **large-scale, transactional systems** requiring **high consistency** and data integrity.
- **MongoDB** shines when dealing with **unstructured data** and requires **scalability** with high **write throughput**. It's an excellent choice for **NoSQL** applications that need flexibility.
- **MariaDB** is a powerful, **MySQL-compatible option**, ideal for **web applications** and **real-time analytics**. It's well-suited for **read-heavy workloads** and offers **high compatibility** with MySQL.

For most applications, **PostgreSQL** stands out as the best solution when you need performance, scalability, and maintainability all in one. MongoDB and MariaDB excel in specific use cases like NoSQL data handling and MySQL compatibility respectively.
