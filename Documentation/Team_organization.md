# Organization Method: Kanban

## Why Choose Kanban?

We opted for the Kanban method to organize and manage our project. This choice is based on the many advantages offered by this approach, particularly in terms of flexibility and priority management.

## Kanban Principles

1. **Visualization of Workflow**:
   - With a digital board using GitHub project, we can visualize all ongoing tasks and their progress.
   - This allows the team to easily track the status of each task.

2. **Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)**:
   - Kanban encourages limiting the number of tasks in progress to avoid work overload and ensure better focus on priorities.

3. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - The Kanban board helps quickly identify blockages, facilitating necessary adjustments to optimize the flow.

## Advantages for Our Project

1. **Adaptability**:
   - Kanban is a flexible method that adapts to the specific needs of the project. It allows us to adjust our priorities based on emergencies or changes in the specifications.

2. **Visibility and Transparency**:
   - Each team member has a clear view of what needs to be done, what is in progress, and what is completed. This promotes communication and collaboration.

3. **Better Priority Management**:
   - By ranking tasks by order of priority and focusing on a limited number of tasks at a time, we improve our productivity and avoid unnecessary delays.

## Implementation in Our Team

- A Kanban board will be set up via GitHub project.
- The columns will represent the different stages of our workflow, for example:
  - **To Do** (Backlog)
  - **In Progress** (In Progress)
  - **In Review** (Review)
  - **Done** (Done)
- We will organize regular meetings to update the board and discuss priorities.

By adopting this method, we aim to optimize time by fostering a collaborative work environment.
